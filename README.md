# Custom-Chatbot-using-Langchain

A knowledge-driven chatbot application that leverages LangChain for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using content from specified URLs. This project uses ChromaDB for storing embeddings and Flask for the web interface, creating a chatbot capable of generating precise answers based on a specific knowledge base.

## Features

- **Custom Knowledge Base**: Scrapes and stores data from URLs for use in chatbot responses.
- **RAG Architecture**: Combines retrieval from the knowledge base with a language model to answer questions contextually.
- **ChromaDB Integration**: Uses ChromaDB for efficient vector storage and retrieval of document embeddings.
- **Flask Web Interface**: Lightweight, interactive web front end for user interaction.
  
## Tech Stack

- **LangChain**: Manages the chatbot pipeline, including embedding generation and retrieval processes.
- **ChromaDB**: Stores and retrieves embeddings generated by the chatbot.
- **Flask**: Serves the web interface, handling user input and displaying responses.
- **HTML and CSS**: Provides a simple frontend for interacting with the chatbot.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or above
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Custom-Chatbot-using-Langchain.git
   cd Custom-Chatbot-using-Langchain

2. **Set Up the Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
## Configuration

- Ensure the URL sources are correctly defined in the script, under urls (I have included some random url).
- You can also include multiple url under urls

## Running the ChatBot

1. Start the Flask Application
   ```bash
   python app.py
2. Access the Chatbot
   - Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to interact with the chatbot. (as I have mentioned that port in the code, you can also change as per you wish)
